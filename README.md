## Pet Stats

- **🍖 Hunger** - Decreases over time. Feed your pet to restore.
- **😊 Happiness** - Decreases slowly. Play to make your pet happy!
- **⚡ Energy** - Decreases from activities. Sleep to restore.
- **🧼 Cleanliness** - Decreases over time. Clean regularly!
- **❤️ Health** - Affected by all other stats. Keep everything balanced!

## Evolution Stages

Your pet evolves based on age (measured in "ticks"):

1. **🥚 Egg** (0-9 ticks) - Just hatched!
2. **🐣 Baby** (10-49 ticks) - Needs lots of care
3. **🐱 Child** (50-149 ticks) - Growing up!
4. **🐯 Teen** (150-299 ticks) - Almost there
5. **🦁 Adult** (300+ ticks) - Fully grown!

## Custom Sprites

VSCode Tamagotchi features hand-crafted SVG sprites for each evolution stage:

- **Egg** - A mysterious glowing egg with cracks
- **Baby** - A cute blob with an antenna
- **Child** - An adorable creature with ears and whiskers
- **Teen** - A cool striped pet with pointed ears
- **Adult** - A majestic creature with a flowing mane

Plus special states:

- **Sleeping** - Curled up with ZZZs
- **Sick** - With thermometer and sweat drops
- **Ghost** - When your pet passes away (don't let this happen!)

All sprites support custom colors via CSS variables, so you can create your own unique pet!

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Compile TypeScript
pnpm run compile

# Watch for changes
pnpm run watch

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Package extension
pnpm run package
```

## Tips

- Don't let any stat drop below 20% or your pet's health will suffer
- Balance playtime with rest - too much playing exhausts your pet
- Your pet's lifecycle pauses when VSCode is closed - no decay while you're away!
- If your pet dies, use the Reset command to hatch a new egg
- Try different color presets to find your favorite look!
- Mix themes and colors for unique combinations
