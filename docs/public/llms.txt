# VSCode Tamagotchi

> A virtual Tamagotchi pet that lives in your VSCode/Cursor editor.

A VSCode extension that lets you raise a virtual Tamagotchi pet while you code. Your pet evolves through 5 stages (Egg, Baby, Child, Teen, Adult), has stats you must manage (hunger, happiness, energy, cleanliness, health), and features custom SVG sprites with fully customizable colors. The extension supports multiple themes, configurable positioning within the editor, and persistent state across sessions.
